This is a preliminary draft which needs to be converted into a web page.

Grooved joins:
Used only between 2 main pipes and in place of a pipe break. For example it is always used at an Ell.

Takeout depends on the angle made.
In case of 0deg (coupling) there is no takeout (pipes touch directly).
If angle is 90deg and diameters are the same then takeout depends on the diameter and vendor.
To find it, drill to /info[outlet="Ddd"]/groovedByAngle/entry[key="deg90"]/value/byVendor/entry[key="vvv"]/value

Welded connection and mechanical tee/cross.

Used between a main pipe and an orthogonal pipe of equal or lesser diameter.
In this case the main pipe is not cut. Instead a hole is drilled in it and an attachment placed.
The end of that attachment may be either threaded or grooved.
If the ortho-pipe is a branch then the end has to be treaded.
Takeout depends on 2 diameters (oo,mm) and the 3 types just described (2 for branches). Drill to:
/info[outlet="Doo"]/byDiameter/entry[key="Dmm"]/value/byAttachment/entry[key=type]/value
