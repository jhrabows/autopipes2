The functionality of this application has been grouped into service classes.
This package contains all external client entry points which
require orchestration of multiple service calls. This includes
all WebService calls made from AutoCAD as well as the primary DWR
calls. Simple CRUD calls are exposed to DWR directly in the Storage service.
The WebService calls are annotated with @PayloadRoot.
All exposed DWR calls are included with the dwr:remote tag in spring configuration.
